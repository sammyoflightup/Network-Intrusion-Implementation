# Network Intrusion Detection Systems Implementation

## Project Overview
This project involves the implementation of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) to monitor and analyze network traffic for potential threats. The goal is to enhance network security by detecting malicious activities in real-time.

## Objectives
- Set up a NIDS to monitor network traffic continuously.
- Detect potential security threats and respond accordingly.
- Create reports for further analysis and security improvements.

## Tools Used
- **Snort**: An open-source intrusion detection system that inspects network traffic and logs packet data.
- **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer for capturing and examining packets in detail.
- **Suricata**: A high-performance NIDS that provides real-time threat detection capabilities.
- **Kali Linux**: A specialized operating system for penetration testing and security assessments.
- **VirtualBox**: A virtualization tool to create isolated environments for testing purposes.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
- **Create a Virtual Network**: Use VirtualBox to create a virtual network with:
  - A Linux server running Snort or Suricata.
  - A client machine to generate various network traffic.
- **Configure Network Settings**: Ensure that all network traffic flows through the NIDS.

### 2. Install and Configure Snort
- **Install Snort**: Install Snort on the Linux server.
- **Network Interface Configuration**: Configure Snort to monitor specific network interfaces.
- **Log Settings**: Set up logging to capture alerts and traffic data.

### 3. Develop Custom Detection Rules
- **Create Snort Rules**: Write custom rules to identify specific threats such as port scans and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Test Rules**: Verify the effectiveness of these rules to minimize false positives.

### 4. Generate Network Traffic
- **Simulate Attacks**: Use tools like Metasploit to create various network traffic scenarios, including:
  - Port scanning.
  - Network attacks (e.g., SYN floods).
- **Capture Packets**: Use Wireshark to capture and analyze packets during the simulation.

### 5. Monitor and Analyze Alerts
- **Review Alerts**: Monitor real-time alerts generated by Snort during the traffic simulations.
- **Analyze Traffic**: Examine captured packets to understand the nature of detected threats.

### 6. Compile a Report
- **Document Findings**: Prepare a report that summarizes:
  - The deployment process and tools used.
  - Types of threats detected during testing.
  - Recommendations for enhancing network security based on findings.

## Key Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience in setting up and configuring a Network Intrusion Detection System.
- Improved skills in threat detection and response.
- Developed a better understanding of network traffic patterns and attack methodologies.
